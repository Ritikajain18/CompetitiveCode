Fibonacci Search

Given a sorted array arr[] of size n and an element x to be searched in it. Return index of x if it is present in array else return -1.
Examples:

Input:  arr[] = {2, 3, 4, 10, 40}, x = 10
Output:  3
Element x is present at index 3.

Input:  arr[] = {2, 3, 4, 10, 40}, x = 11
Output:  -1
Element x is not present.
Fibonacci Search is a  comparison-based technique that uses Fibonacci numbers to search an element in a sorted array.
